# Computer-Vision
This repository contains the projects that I completed out of interest apart from my curriculum. This contains the following files:

= >  laneDetection.py
This file is a small project excerpted from the Udemy course, "Applied Deep Learning- Full Self Driving car course". This file helps to find the lane lines for the
input feed.

= >  mnistImageRecognition.ipynb
Program for classifying the digits using deep learning networks in Jupyter notebook

= > trafficSignClassifier.ipynb
Program for classifying among 43 traffic signs using deep learning networks Jupyter notebook.

= >  test_image.jpg 
A sample image that is fed for finding lanes

= >  app.py
Contains the main python file that detects through masking cars using opencv and haarcascade classifier

= >  cars.mp4
The sample video that is fed to the model

= >  haarCascadeClassifier.xml
The pretrained classifier for detecting cars in the input
