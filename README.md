# Computer-Vision
This repository contains the projects that I completed out of interest apart from my curriculum. This contains the following files:
= > 1. app.py
Contains the main python file that detects through masking cars using opencv and haarcascade classifier

= > 2. cars.mp4
The sample video that is fed to the model

= > 3. haarcascade_car.xml
The pretrained classifier for detecting cars in the input

= > 4. lanes_detection.py
This file is a small project excerpted from the Udemy course, "Applied Deep Learning- Full Self Driving car course". This file helps to find the lane lines for the
input feed.

= > 5. test_image.jpg 
A sample image that is fed for finding lanes
